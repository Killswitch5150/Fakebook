Fakebook.com
A mock social media site, AKA a javascript project to help me get better at coding
Work began 12/19/2023
Most recently updated 12/21/2023

Most recent changes:
- Removed regUname variable that was not being used
- Set all console output to only be visible if isDebugging === true
- Removed all references to isAuthed variable as it has been deprecated and is not used for any conditions
- Got rid of any instance of username being echoed back through dialogue and replaced with more standardized messages
- Debugging mode can be entered through username field so console output appears using 'isDebugging true' or 'isDebugging false' respectively
- Got rid of 'Login to continue' prompt text. Now it only appears when guiding the end user
- Implemented page title dynamics depending on if user is signing up or logging in
- Feedback element on login page will now indicate when entering or leaving debug mode

To do list:
- Move script to its own .js page assuming it wont break the functionality of the website
- Figure out what I am going to do with feed.html
    - Ideally I want to have functionality like this:
        - Create post -> save into text file or similar
            - Website loads everything in the file no matter who posted it
                - Website displays it all on the feed as posts
                    - User should be able to create a post, log out, log in as another user and still see the post, even if they reload/exit browser (will likely require SQLite)
        - Original posters should be able to edit and delete their own posts (or atleast delete)
        - Maybe implement a "sharing" option for users to engage on others posts
        - Maybe implement a "comment" option for users to interact with each other
        - All posts should have a title and body text
        - An open ended array should be used so that the website could theoretically have unlimited posts
    - If that doesnt work, my idea:
        - IRC chatroom with maybe 10 rooms to join
        - Text box at the bottom to write out a message and hit send or a button to post it to the room
        - Have chat populate above and have it saved to a text or SQLite file so it can be seen by all users on the platform
- Implement correct notation similar to this page, on to feed.html, complete with formatting corrections in code, comments, and a to do list specific to the feed page
- Research VS Code options for:
        - Open a remote window
        - Port Forwarding
        - Go Live (run a live server)
            - And figure out how to use these features and if they will benefit me for my testing purposes

Possible implementations:
- SQLite or other database for the usernames and passwords
    - Encrypting password data before it goes to sqlite if sqlite doesnt encrypt by default
- Maybe add a picture or something on the home screen, idk it's pretty boring, a slightly transparent pic could look cool in the blue gradient, behind the login form
- Implement a password complexity rule and checker using if statements or maybe switches
    - Ideally, one uppercase, one lowercase, 6 chars, one special character
    - Show the user which rules are not being followed if a password is not acceptable
- Implement a username complexity rule and checker using if statements or maybe switches
    - Only rule should be length, longer than 2 characters
- Mess around with formatting to make it all prettier
- I may not need the <div> class anymore. I implemented it for css purposes, but I think it can be removed without losing functionality or formatting
- The text boxes may be able to be put into a <form> class. They were in one at a point and I lost functionality. I can try to implement it again in the future, low priority.
- Maybe do something where the experience for the user logged in as Admin is different from others.
    - If I get user posts working maybe I can implement a role system and have admin give people roles as moderators, who can delete other users posts
    - Or maybe only admin can delete other peoples posts
    - Admin should be able to maybe load up and edit the SQLite DB when it is established
        - So admin can delete/disable accounts of malicious users/etc
- Maybe add a feature for registration mode, that makes another text box come into existence, that asks user to confirm their password (type it again)
    - Ensure passwords match (through if statements, give error messages accordingly, if they do not)
    - Maybe add an email field too, though I doubt I'll do anything with it, especially if I go the IRC chatroom route
        - Could just have it save to the SQLite DB (once implemented) and decide if I wanted to keep it or get rid of it to promote user anonymity on the platform
- Somehow sanitize user input (particularly username) before transit to next web page, potential xss/html inserts
