Fakebook was a micro-project I made in December 2023 to brush up on HTML and CSS while I was learning JavaScript. I have no plans to support this project further.
As the project sits in it's current state it is essentially a login form simulation which allows the end user to create a locally stored account and log in and out.
No data is stored on any server or cloud, and I never got to configuring a database locally either, so upon reloading the webpage all stored data is lost and reset
to what is coded.
