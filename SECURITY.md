# Security Policy

This code is provided as-is with no guarantee of best practices in terms of security, coding, design or elsewhere. There are known security vulnerabilities in this code, and if you plan on using this code in your own project, you are responsible yourself for
both identifying and patching and vulnerabilities in the code, as I, the creator, hold no responsibility for any issues contained in this code. This was a coding project for me, and not meant to be security focused. Known issues include code injection in the
input fields used for logging in/registering an account. Be mindful that users of your site could be subject to cyber attacks if this issue is not fixed before it is deployed.

## Supported Versions

This is an abandoned project and there is no guarantee or commitment from me, the original developer, as far as long term support, patches, or any continued updates, past the point of the initial release of this template.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

While continued support is not offered for this project, you are encouraged to report any bugs, issues, or other vulnerabilities on the GitHub Issues tab, so that a community member might find the issue and patch it.
